This repo provides a detailed layerwise analysis of computational complexity in convolutional neural networks

Analysis includes layerwise breakdowns of:
    1. number of weight parameters
    2. number of MAC operations
    3. number of dot products
    4. dot product dimensions
    5. input and output dimensions
